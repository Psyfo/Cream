                            A black consciousness militant movement which practiced self-defense for minority communities against the US government, and whose aim was to establish revolutionary socialism through mass organizing and community based programs. During this period, you have Tiana, a 12 year old, dark skinned African American girl striving to gain love and acceptance from her Anglo-thinking, Southern Born, very light skinned grandmother, Grandma Stevens who loathes her. Given the impression by Grandma Stevens that the resentment and hate stems from her dark skin, Tiana continues to use bleaching cream in an attempt to get to the right skin tone which will appease her Grandmother. Her world changes when she meets Joy and Sean who are affiliated with the Black Panther's Society. Painted as "armed and dangerous" by the police and initially seen negatively, these two arrive at Grandma Steven's house forcibly seeking refuge until the mayhem of riots brought on by the assassination of MLK blows over. Joy makes Tiana question her ideology of love and acceptance given to her by Grandma Stevens and introduces concepts of black pride and self-love. Torn between this newfound ideology, Tiana must make a choice as to whether or not she wishes to continue using the cream or remain the way she is .
